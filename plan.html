    <div class = "phase0">
    <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h2>
    <h3>What is the problem that this program aims to solve?</h3>
        <p>Create an HTTP server using the python standard <code>http.server</code> library. This server will
            allow us to, using our html pages from last assignment, respond to GET requests and serve our blog to our browser</p>
    <h3>What I already know</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the most part I understand how my website works currently</li>
            <li>Mostly everything else I need to learn</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Things I need to learn</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Net cat: done</li>
             <li>Response headers: done</li>
             <li>Favicon: done</li>
             <li>Interpret and respond to HTTP requests: done</li>
             <li>Control the browser using HTTP status codes: done</li>
             <li>MIME types: done</li>
             <li>Dynamically-generated pages: done</li>
             <li>handle client errors: done</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Challenges that I forsee</h3>
        <p>There seems to be a lot of moving parts and a lot of things that I don't know how to do. I am going to need to stay organized, so
        that I don't miss requirements or do things incorrectly. My SDP is going to be really important because if I don't figure out what I don't know
        ahead of time and break down the tasks into manageable pieces, I am going to end up wasting a lot of time trying to just wing
        it when figuring things out. I also am going to need to go back and forth between the assignment description and documentation pages
        so that I can figure out what I need to do and learn how to do it. I think this assignment is going to take me awhile since there are so many
        things that I don't know how to do, so I need to spend my time wisely, start early, and work on the project almost everyday.</p>

        <h4>Things the reponse header must have:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Server and Date</li>
            <li>Connection: close</li>
            <li>Cache-Control: max-age=X</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Use <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> status code with location header</li>
                <li>Tells client to go to alternate location for resources</li>
                <li>Browser follows suggestions and transitions user seamlessly</li>
            </ul>

       <h3>Response headers</h3>
        <h4>Things the reponse header must have. Note 2 can be totally taken care of with a few provided methods. </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Server and Date: <code>self.send_response(int)</code> where int is the response code. Will print out something like: <code>127.0.0.1 - - [20/Sep/2021 19:43:09] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 -</code> </li>
            <li>Connection: close </li>
            <li class = "question">Cache-Control: max-age=" X seconds". Says to just pick a small value. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Things the response header may have:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Content-Length:  You may measure the length of a bytes() object in the same way you would a string.</li>
                <li>Content-Type: Takes a MIME type. You know a priori, the MIME type of the server-generated pages and should hard code this into responses. Use the python <code>mimetypes.guess_type()</code> function to determine the MIME type based on their filename </li>
                <li>Location: only for 301 redirects I think tells the new location</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Format for this: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>open file i.e. index.html: f = open('index.html', 'rb')</li>
                <li>read it into a bytestring: dat = f.read()</li>
                <li>close file: f.close()</li>
                <li>get data: content_length = len(dat) </li>
                <li>send the data with self.wfile.write(): self.wfile.write(bytes(f"Content-Length: {content_length}\n", "utf-8")) and self.wfile.write(dat)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>301 redirects</h3>
            <ul>

    <h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>
    <h3>Things that were different than I expected and lessons learned</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>end_headers() does the new line character for you</li>
        <li>It would have been better to ask if a file exists rather than doing a bunch of if/else statements. That will be good to know for the future.</li>
        <li>I should have timed myself to see how long certain things took me to help me with estimations in the future</li>
        <li>This assignment really didn't have much code to write, but it took me awhile</li>
        <li>I should have looked at the assignment earlier, so that the lectures made a little more sense the first time. I had to rewatch a lot of stuff.</li>

    <h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
        <h3>What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?</h3>
            <p>The implementation section of my SDP was kinda weird because this document is in HTML,
            but my implementation was in python</p>

        <h3> Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?</h3>
            <p>Some things seem to happen automagically, but with the addition of various methods
            I for the most part understand why my server is able to do different things</p>

        <h3>If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?</h3>
            <p>I am not sure. There are a lot of files all working together, but I don't think it would
            take me terribly long. Some of my bugs when I was writing the server were tough to figure out,
            but since at this point everything works, I think it would be easier to debug something
            new that comes up.</p>

        <h3>Will your document make sense to anybody besides yourself?</h3>
            <p>Yes. It seems that although you can structure your server differently, the optimal methods
            are all about the same, so while it would take a minute to figure out the differences in
            the structuring of my methods I believe that all of my peers who completed this assignment
            could find there way around and work with the server.</p>

        <h3>Will your document make sense to yourself in 6 months time?</h3>
            <p>Yes I think so. I kept everything organized and tried to minimize writing duplicate code as much as
            possible. I think I could add new files pretty easy and make changes down the road.</p>

        <h3>How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?</h3>
            <p>Now that I know how to read the docs, I think it would be easy to identify where in the code
            to add the feature and also how to do it successfully.</p>

        <h3>Will your program continue to work after upgrading your computer's hardware, the OS, the next version?</h3>
            <p>It should. I think I stuck to the standards well.</p>
